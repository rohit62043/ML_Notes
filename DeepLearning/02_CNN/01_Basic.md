# Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## CNN Basics

**CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** is a type of neural network primarily used for image-related tasks. Its architecture is unique compared to regular artificial neural networks (ANNs) and includes layers such as:

- **Convolutional Layers**
- **Pooling Layers**
- **Fully Connected Layers**

## Understanding Convolutional Layers

### Operation Basics

Convolutions are the primary operation in CNNs where **filters** (or **kernels**) slide over the input image to extract specific features like edges or textures.

### Biological Inspiration

The structure of CNNs is inspired by the human visual system. Just as different neurons in the brain detect specific patterns in vision, CNN layers learn to recognize image features such as edges, corners, and textures.

## Image Types

### Grayscale vs. RGB

- **Grayscale**: Single channel, varying shades from black to white. Each pixel has a value between 0-255, indicating its intensity.
- **RGB**: Three channelsâ€”Red, Green, Blue. These channels combine to create colors.

## Feature Extraction

### Role of Early CNN Layers

Early layers in a CNN extract basic features (edges, simple textures). As you move deeper into the network, more complex features (shapes, object parts) are extracted, allowing the model to understand and classify objects.

### How Convolution Works

In a convolution operation, a **filter** (or **kernel**) is applied to an image, multiplying the filter values with corresponding pixel values and summing them up to create an output called a **"feature map."**

## Filter Sizes and Strides

### Filter Application

A filter slides over the input image (with specified stride and padding). The filter size determines the level of detail extracted:

- **Smaller Filters**: Capture finer details.
- **Larger Filters**: Capture broader patterns.

### Stride and Padding

- **Stride**: The step size of the filter as it moves across the image. Larger strides reduce the size of the feature map.
- **Padding**: Adding borders to the image allows filters to process edges more effectively.

## Mathematics Behind Convolutions

### Element-wise Multiplication

When a filter is applied to an image, each pixel in the image is multiplied by the corresponding element in the filter. The results are summed to produce a single number representing part of the feature map.

### Non-linearity (Activation Function)

After convolution, a non-linear activation function (like **ReLU**) is applied, introducing non-linearity to the model and enabling it to learn more complex patterns.

## Pooling Layers

### Purpose of Pooling

Pooling layers reduce the size of the feature maps while preserving essential features. This process is a form of down-sampling and is typically applied after convolution layers.

### Types of Pooling

- **Max Pooling**: Takes the maximum value from a group of pixels in the feature map.
- **Average Pooling**: Takes the average of a group of pixels.

## End-to-End Learning in CNNs

### Training the Filters

CNNs do not require manually defined filters. During training, the network learns the optimal filter values through **backpropagation** and **gradient descent**, allowing CNNs to adapt and optimize for the specific task.

### Feature Maps as Input for Next Layers

The resulting feature map from the convolution operation serves as the input for the next layer. Multiple filters result in multiple feature maps, often visualized as 3D volumes.

## Final Steps in CNNs

### Fully Connected Layers

After several convolution and pooling layers, the feature maps are flattened into a single vector and fed into fully connected layers. These layers act as a classifier, determining the final output (e.g., identifying whether an image contains a cat or a dog).
